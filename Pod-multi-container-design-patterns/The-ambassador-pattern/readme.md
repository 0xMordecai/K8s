# The ambassador pattern
The ambassador pattern derives its name from an ambassador, an envoy representing a country overseas. You can also think of an ambassador as a proxy of a particular application. Let’s say, for example, that you have migrated one of your existing Python Flask applications to containers, and one of your containers needs to communicate with a Redis database. The database always existed in the local host. Therefore, the database connection details within your application contain localhost everywhere.
