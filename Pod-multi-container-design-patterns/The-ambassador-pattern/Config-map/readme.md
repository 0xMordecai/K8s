# Config map
A config map contains key-value pairs that we can use for various purposes, such as defining environment-specific properties or injecting an external variable at container startup or during runtime.

**The idea of the config map is to decouple the application with configuration and to externalize configuration at a Kubernetes level. It is similar to using a properties file, for example, to define the environment-specific configuration.**
