# Installing KinD

**KinD allows you to run a multi-node Kubernetes cluster on a single server that runs Docker. We understand that a multi-node Kubernetes cluster requires multiple machines, but how can we run a multi-node Kubernetes cluster on a single server? The answer is simple: KinD uses a Docker container as a Kubernetes node. So, if we need a four-node Kubernetes cluster, KinD will spin up four containers that behave like four Kubernetes nodes. It is as simple as that.**
