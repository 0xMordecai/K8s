# Installing KinD

**KinD allows you to run a multi-node Kubernetes cluster on a single server that runs Docker. We understand that a multi-node Kubernetes cluster requires multiple machines, but how can we run a multi-node Kubernetes cluster on a single server? The answer is simple: KinD uses a Docker container as a Kubernetes node. So, if we need a four-node Kubernetes cluster, KinD will spin up four containers that behave like four Kubernetes nodes. It is as simple as that.**

**While you need Docker to run KinD, KinD internally uses containerd as a container runtime instead of Docker. Containerd implements the container runtime interface; therefore, Kubernetes does not require any specialized components, such as dockershim, to interact with it. This means that KinD still works with Kubernetes since Docker isn’t supported anymore as a Kubernetes container runtime.**

**As KinD supports a multi-node Kubernetes cluster, you can use it for your development activities and also in your CI/CD pipelines. In fact, KinD redefines CI/CD pipelines as you don’t require a static Kubernetes environment to test your build. KinD is swift to boot up, which means you can integrate the bootstrapping of the KinD cluster, run and test your container builds within the cluster, and then destroy it all within your CI/CD pipeline. This gives development teams immense power and speed.**
