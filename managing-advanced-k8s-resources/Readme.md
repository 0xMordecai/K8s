# Managing Advanced Kubernetes Resources

**In the previous chapter, we covered `Kubernetes` and why we need it and then discussed bootstrapping a Kubernetes cluster using `MiniKube` and `KinD`. We then looked at the `Pod resource` and discussed how to create and manage pods, how to troubleshoot them, and how to ensure your application’s reliability using `probes`, along with `multi-container` design patterns to appreciate why Kubernetes uses pods in the first place instead of containers. We also looked at `Secrets` and `ConfigMaps`.**

Now, we will dive deep into the advanced aspects of Kubernetes and Kubernetes command-line best practices.
