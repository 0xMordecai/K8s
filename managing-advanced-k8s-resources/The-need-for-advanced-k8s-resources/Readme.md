# The need for advanced Kubernetes resources

**In the last chapter, we looked at pods, the basic building blocks of Kubernetes that provide everything for your containers to run within a Kubernetes environment.

The reason is that while they define a container application and its specification, they do not replicate, auto-heal, or maintain a particular state. When you delete a pod, the pod is gone.**
