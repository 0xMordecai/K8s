# ReplicaSet resources
**`ReplicaSet resources are Kubernetes controllers that help you run multiple pod replicas at a given time`. They provide horizontal scaling for your container workloads, forming the basic building block of a horizontal scale set for your containers, `a group of similar containers tied together to run as a unit`.**
